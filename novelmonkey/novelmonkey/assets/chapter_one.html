<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Provincetown’s newest deputy sheriff pulled her cruiser to a stop in the parking lot overlooking Herring Cove. It was six a.m. on a clear, crisp morning in May. Other than a Winnebago parked at the far end of the lot, she was alone. To her right stretched the curve of sand leading to Race Point, and in the distance, she could make out the figures of a few early-morning walkers. Seagulls swayed low over the ocean, searching for their breakfast, their shrill calls echoing on the wind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">The water reflected the color of the nearly cloudless sky, iridescent blues and greens slashed through by the frothy white of the churning waves. The air carried the damp mist that hovered over the dunes, chilling her skin. Despite the cold, she had rolled the windows down, allowing the scent and sounds of the sea to flow through the vehicle. A coffee cup sat on the dash, tendrils of steam drifting off on the breeze. Unconsciously, she shifted her wide leather belt, settling her holstered automatic more comfortably against her right hip.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Reaching for her coffee, she let her gaze idly follow a trawler far out on the bay. Her mind held no distinct thoughts, only the impressions of the timeless forces of nature that surrounded her. She felt totally insignificant—yet completely at peace—and more at home than ever. That fact should have been surprising, considering that she had only called this tiny town on the curving finger of land thrust arrogantly out into the Atlantic Ocean <em class="italic">home </em>for a few weeks. She had moved across the country to a place she had never even visited before and left behind a life that had shaped her since she was a child. Nevertheless, it felt right to be here now, in this place, at this point in her life, and she accepted it with the equanimity with which she had been trained to face all the circumstances life presented.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">A flash of color close to shore caught her attention, and a red kayak with a bright yellow racing stripe slid into view. The powerful rhythmic strokes of the kayaker propelled the craft swiftly over the water, but rather than disrupting the quietude, the churning arms and slicing paddle blended with the motion of the waves, harmonizing with the bay’s pulsing tides. She watched until the craft was just a dot on the horizon before starting her engine and pulling slowly away from the water’s edge.</span></p>
<div class="calibre4"/>

<div class="calibre4"/>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Sheriff Nelson Parker glanced up as the door to the station house opened, admitting a small gust of wind that rustled the papers on his desk. The sheriff’s department was one large room. There was a small waiting area just inside the front door. Beyond that, on the other side of a low railing with a latched gate that squeaked when opened, was a section that contained several desks pushed close together and the dispatch center. In an adjoining room, at the rear of the building, were two holding cells that rarely saw any use. The sheriff himself was a hardy man in his early forties whose thick dark hair was free of gray and whose sharp eyes were winter gray.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">As his deputy entered on the tail of the draft, he was surprised once again by the slight disquiet he felt whenever he saw her. Maybe it was her height—she was damn near as tall as he was—or maybe it was the ramrod straight way she carried herself, no matter what the situation. Broad shouldered and firmly muscled, she was in better physical shape than any of his men. The trim fit of her crisply starched, flawlessly pressed khaki uniform reminded him once again that he needed to work off those extra twenty pounds that seemed to have settled all too unyieldingly around his waist. Maybe it was only that she seemed totally unaware of how imposingly good-looking she was. She certainly <em class="italic">seemed</em> oblivious to the appreciative glances she got when the two of them were out walking the streets—especially from the women. <em class="italic">Jesus. I think I might be jealous. Damned idiot.</em></span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Morning, Chief,” she said, heading for the small corner counter and the coffeemaker. A frown creased the sculpted features of her angular face as she tilted the pot to skeptically survey the two inches of dark liquid in the bottom. “Last night’s?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“’Fraid so, Reese,” he answered with a shrug. “I just nuked mine and chewed it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Jesus,” she muttered, dumping the remains in the nearby sink. “That looks worse than the sludge from my old duty office. And I wouldn’t even drink <em class="italic">that</em> unless I was half dead.” She started a fresh pot and settled behind the desk that was situated across a narrow aisle from his. There were a few reports from the night shift stacked in the bin, and she picked them up to review.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Anything I should know?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Nothing out of the ordinary. A few traffic stops for speeding, one DUI, and a couple of bar brawls down at the Governor Bradford.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">She glanced at the calendar displayed in one corner of the bulletin board. It was less than two weeks until Memorial Day weekend. She had not yet experienced the transformation that reportedly befell the tiny fishing village with the onset of the summer season, but she’d heard about it many times already in her short time in Provincetown. From the end of May until after Labor Day, a flood of tourists would swell the normal population of several thousand to many times that number. Most of the townspeople depended on the influx of visitors to support their economy, despite the constant complaints by the year-rounders of the hectic crowds and unmanageable traffic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Not much happening until the big weekend, I expect,” Reese observed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Nope,” the sheriff agreed. “But after that, you can expect a lot of traffic, both vehicular and foot, more accidents, more nightlife, and more drunk and disorderlies. Four months of nonstop pandemonium, and then eight months of deadly quiet.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Reese filed the reports silently, envisioning the upcoming weeks of work.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Think you’ll be able to stand the off-season?” Parker asked. “By December, you’ll be able to see the length of Commercial Street without a car blocking your view. You’ll walk down the street and the only footprints in the snow will be yours.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Reese looked up in surprise, her blue eyes questioning. “Why should that bother me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">He shrugged, curiosity warring with his sense of diplomacy. She’d been working for him for almost a month, and he didn’t know word one about her personal life. She never mentioned her past or spoke of any family. He found it hard to believe that someone who looked like her wasn’t attached some way. Still, she never left any room for those kinds of questions, and he often found himself fishing for some clue to her, beyond the impersonal data in her resume. “Well, it’s probably not the kind of life you’ve been used to.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Reese fiercely guarded her privacy. Not only was it instinctual, it was also learned. She fought the urge to leave his unspoken question unanswered. This man was her boss and likely to be the person she would spend most of her time with in the coming months. In his own way, he was trying to be friendly. She reminded herself she had nothing to hide. “The life I was used to was military life, Sheriff. It can be <em class="italic">very </em>boring in its own way. It hasn’t changed much in two hundred years.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“You know, you’re way overqualified for this job,” he continued. “I knew that when I hired you. I just couldn’t <em class="italic">not </em>hire you, what with your experience as a MP and a law degree thrown in.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Still struggling with her unease at casual conversation, Reese contemplated how much she wanted to share. Her social interactions were molded by a lifetime in the military, a rigid hierarchical world where relationships were defined and shaped by rank and politics. There were rules determining where you ate, where you slept, and <em class="italic">with whom</em> you could and could not sleep. There were ways around those rules, if you were careful and so inclined. Reese had never found the need to challenge them, but she was far from naïve about the consequences. Revealing your thoughts, and certainly your feelings, could be dangerous and, in some instances, deadly. As a young officer candidate she had been taught there were only three acceptable answers to any question or request put to her by a superior—<em class="italic">yes sir,</em>
<em class="italic">no sir,</em> and <em class="italic">no excuse, sir.</em></span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">But this was not the Marines, it was a new life. She took a breath. “After fifteen years, I found I was getting a little cramped in the military. I had to make a decision to stay for the rest of my life or make a move. I didn’t like practicing military law, but I liked upholding the law. This job gives me the chance to do that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Trained to provide facts without revealing her emotions, she didn’t even try to explain the unrelenting restlessness she had felt the last few years; she didn’t understand it herself. Whatever it was, it had been strong enough to make her walk away from a brilliant career that also offered financial security and a familiar structure. Looking at her life to that point, she couldn’t fault it—yet still she had left it behind. Now she was here, and she was content with her decision.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Nelson regarded his second intently and wondered what she wasn’t saying. For a moment she’d seemed to let her guard down, and a hint of what might have been sadness had flickered across her face. But now she regarded him impassively once more. Apparently, he had all the answers he was going to get. Gruffly, he added, “Well, I’m glad to have you. And for Christ’s sake, call me Nelson.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Sure thing, Chief,” she responded, suppressing a grin. She brushed the lock of jet-black hair from her forehead with one long-fingered hand, a tiny smile deepening a single dimple to the right of her mouth. Her deep blue eyes were laser-like in their focus. “You want the first circuit through town or do you want me to take it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">He shook his head, trying not to laugh. “You go ahead. I’m waiting for a call about next year’s budget from the county office. God, I hate the paperwork. I should never have run for sheriff. I was much happier as the deputy sheriff.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Too late now,” Reese rejoined, “the job’s taken.” Then she settled her hat over her thick, neatly trimmed hair and snapped the brim with a practiced motion to secure it over her deep-set eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">For a second, Nelson had the urge to salute her. “See you later.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Roger.” Grabbing her keys, Reese headed happily for the door. She loved to be out on patrol, simply observing the day-to-day activities of the community she was making her own. Once in the cruiser, she headed east out Route 6 toward Truro and then turned back on 6A when she reached the town limits. She’d nearly completed her slow tour through the still-sleeping village when the radio crackled to life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Reese?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Here,” she answered, thumbing the mike.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“They need you out at the medical clinic on Holland Road. A break-in.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Two minutes,” she replied tersely as she wheeled her cruiser up one of the narrow side streets that crisscrossed the main part of town, while flipping her lights on with one hand. “Is there a suspect on the scene?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Negative. But keep an eye out on your way. The doc just got there, so we don’t know how long the suspect’s been gone. And Reese? The doctor is inside the building.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Roger that,” Reese replied curtly. <em class="italic">Perfect.</em></span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">A civilian in an unsecured building could easily turn into a hostage situation. At the very least, it made her reconnaissance more difficult because she had to be on guard for innocent bystanders as well as the possible perpetrator. She did not use her siren. If anyone was still on the premises, it was best not to broadcast an alert. For the same reason, she did not want an army of police cars barreling into the scene. Not that there <em class="italic">was </em>an army of patrol cars in the small Provincetown force. “I’ll call in when I’ve checked the area. Hold the backup for now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">She saw no one suspicious as she traveled the short distance to the East End Health Clinic, and when she pulled slowly into the small parking lot, it was empty except for a Jeep Cherokee with a kayak roped to the top. She recognized the red craft she had seen an hour earlier on the bay. Angling her cruiser across the drive, she effectively blocked the exit. Once on foot, she drew her automatic and quickly circled the building, noting the shattered window at the rear of the small one-story structure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Moving cautiously to the far side of the clinic and around to the front again, Reese was on full alert as the front door slowly opened. In the entryway was an auburn-haired woman in a white lab coat, leaning slightly on a burnished mahogany cane. The lower end of a leg brace was apparent below the cuff of her creased blue jeans. When she saw Reese, automatic in hand, crouched in a shooter’s stance at the foot of the steps, her hazel eyes widened in concern. “What—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“I’m Deputy Sheriff Conlon, ma’am. I’ll need you to step outside.” Reese lowered her weapon slightly as she spoke. Then she quickly ascended the short flight of stairs, took the other woman firmly by the elbow, and maneuvered her out through the door onto the small porch. “Please wait in the patrol car while I check the building.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“There’s no one here,” the woman replied. “I’ve already looked.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Reese nodded, her eyes already scanning the interior of the clinic. “Just the same, you need to wait outside.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Of course,” the doctor replied. She stepped down off the porch, but then turned back. “Patients will be arriving in a few minutes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Just keep them in the parking lot,” Reese instructed as she moved cautiously into the waiting area. After she checked the offices and examining rooms, she returned to her cruiser and called Nelson. “Chief?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Go ahead, Reese.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“No one on the premises. I’ll be here for a while getting the details.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Okay. Let me know what you get.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Will do.” Reese turned to face the woman beside her. “Let’s go inside so you can fill me in.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Can it wait until later? I have a full schedule, and my office hours are due to start soon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Just some routine questions,” Reese assured her. “I’ll be as quick as I can.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“All right. Let’s get it done.” As they entered the building, the doctor extended her hand and said, “I’m Tory King, by the way. I’m the clinic director.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Reese Conlon, Doctor.” Reese took the offered hand, returning the firm grasp. “Can you tell me what you found when you arrived?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“I opened up at my usual time—seven a.m.,” the doctor said as she led Reese down a corridor to a room at the far end of the building that was apparently her office. A bookcase nearly covered one wall, framed photos and diplomas covered the opposite one, and a broad, dark wood desk sat in front of a window which looked out on the dunes. “I didn’t notice anything amiss until I opened exam room one.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">She grimaced slightly, adding in disgust, “You probably saw the mess for yourself when you searched the building.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Leaning her cane against her desk, Dr. King sat behind it and folded her hands on the scratched surface.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">They were steady, Reese noted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“I called the sheriff immediately. Then I looked around.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6"><em class="italic">A brave but dangerous thing to do</em>. Reese’s face revealed nothing of her thoughts. “Did you see anyone walking on the road before you got here or a car—anything—that seemed out of place?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“No, but then I wasn’t looking for anything.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Reese studied the woman carefully, noting the strong forearms exposed by the rolled-up sleeves of her white coat. Under that, she wore a simple deep blue polo shirt and pressed blue jeans. She appeared to be in her mid-thirties and was lightly tanned, with a smattering of freckles on her cheeks that only added to her attractiveness. She had the well-toned look of an athlete, despite the cane at her side. Raising an eyebrow, Reese asked, “Your kayak out front?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Tory ran a hand absently through the short layers of her shoulder-length hair, shrugging slightly as she did so. “Yes,” she expelled on a breath and waited for the expression of disbelief that usually followed. Most people looked at her leg and assumed she couldn’t manage anything physical. She had come to expect it, but it still angered her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Do you do that every day?” Reese asked pointedly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Yes, why?” Tory replied defensively.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Because in a town this small, any local would know that,” Reese responded evenly, giving no sign that she had heard the edge in the doctor’s tone. “And they would also know when the clinic was empty.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Oh, I see,” Tory murmured, feeling a little foolish at her own reaction. She wasn’t usually so quick to judge, but she found the severely professional woman across from her oddly unsettling. As a doctor, Tory was used to establishing rapport easily with people, and now she felt a little off balance, because the deputy sheriff was so remote as to be unreadable. Why was her cool, controlled manner so disconcerting?<em class="italic"> Her precise, impersonal approach reminds me of some surgeons I’ve known—excellent technicians but no feel for people.</em>
<em class="italic">Perhaps that’s it. She reminds me of K.T.</em></span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Are you all right, Doctor?” Reese asked quietly. The clinic director’s tension was obvious and seemed to be increasing the longer they spoke.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Tory jumped, startled to find her focus wandering. She had obviously been more affected by the violation of her clinic than she had realized—a fact that apparently had <em class="italic">not</em> escaped the notice of the observant sheriff. Tory blushed, embarrassed to appear less than capable in front of this woman, and then quickly wondered why she should care. After taking a deep breath, she let it out slowly. “Yes, I’m fine, thank you. I’m usually much better in a crisis.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“I’m sure that you are, but I don’t imagine you deal with this sort of thing very often.” Reese smiled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Tory’s breath caught at the sudden transformation of the sculpted features that accompanied the brilliant smile. In an instant, the sheriff’s face was suffused with not only compassionate warmth, but also stunning beauty. It was like watching a work of art unexpectedly come to life. What had been remotely perfect before suddenly became something much more affecting. Blushing again at her completely unanticipated visceral reaction, Tory hoped that she wasn’t as transparent as she felt. <em class="italic">God, I never react this way to anyone.</em></span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Gratefully, Tory observed that, at the moment, the dark head was bent over a small notepad balanced on a crossed knee. Taking herself firmly in hand, she replied calmly, “You’re right, this is the first time anything like this has happened here. What can I tell you that will help?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“What’s missing, for starters?” Reese looked up, noting a less guarded countenance and a softening of the doctor’s elegant features.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“I have no idea.” Tory raised her hands in an open gesture. “I’ll have to inventory all the examining rooms and the pharmacy before I have any idea.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“What drugs do you have here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Let me think—antibiotics, a lot of pharmaceutical samples, AIDS meds—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“What about narcotics?” Reese interrupted, still taking notes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Not much. I don’t dispense drugs here, but I need a small quantity of a variety of medications in the event of emergency. I’m the only full-time doctor for thirty-five miles. I have a limited supply of codeine, Percocet, methadone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Injectables?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“About a dozen ampoules of morphine. All of the narcotics are locked in the drug closet.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Was it broken into?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“I didn’t have time to check.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Let’s do that now, please.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">They both stood, and Reese followed the doctor into a small room at the rear of the building that was little more than a walk-in closet. Shelves held linens, sealed surgical packs, IV solutions, and other supplies. A cabinet with a built-in lock was tucked into the corner of the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">The doctor sighed with relief when she saw that the door to the drug locker appeared sound. After inserting a key, she opened the front and scanned the interior. “It looks okay.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Good,” Reese replied. “I’ll need a list of all the employees, the cleaning service, and anyone else who has access to this building. Who owns the building?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“I do.” Tory grasped Reese’s arm as the sheriff turned to leave the storeroom. “There’s no way anyone who works here would do this.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Reese faced the doctor and kept her expression carefully neutral. “I’m sure you’re right. It’s just routine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">After Tory prepared a preliminary list, Reese folded it into her notepad. She studied the doctor for a moment, not missing the slightly distracted look in her eyes. “Are you sure you’re all right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">Tory extended her hand, squared her shoulders, and lifted her chin. She was very aware of being appraised by the cool blue eyes that searched her face questioningly. “I am. Thank you, Sheriff.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre6">“Ma’am.” Reese shook the offered hand, touched her fingers to her cap in brief salute, and left.</span></p>
